                <h2>Fix the EU - by creating a strong political Union</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Over the past sixty years, the EU has grown from a guardian of peace in Europe to something more mean-
                ingful,
                as it now works to secure rights, enhance trade, increase shared prosperity, and protect our heri- tage
                and
                environment. However, crises have shown that our institutions are unable to meet their goals. The EU
                needs
                to be
                reformed as the future lies in a federal and truly democratic Europe that will be led by and built by
                its
                citizens.</p>
            <h2>Governance</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Establish a Federal Europe with a European Government, headed by a Prime Minister elected by the
                    Parliament, and with a President elected by the people. This will create a strong, open and
                    transparent
                    European parliamen- tary democracy.</li>
                <li>Enable the creation of real EU political parties. Current EU parties are loose coalitions of
                    national
                    parties, often with conflicting interests; a real EU democracy needs strong parties defending their
                    vision
                    of the future of Europe.</li>
                <li>Ensure the EU’s ability to act by deciding by majority on all issues in the Councils. Currently,
                    States
                    still decide on many issues by unanimity or consen- sus, making it far easier to block than to act.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Economy and finance</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Make our economy stronger and sustainable through a Eurozone+ budget, a Banking Union, and a full
                    Economic and Monetary Union under a European Finance Minister who will represent the EU.</li>
                <li>Give the European Central Bank the power to support employment and growth, as well as prevent and
                    solve
                    financial crises. Beyond limiting inflation, the European Central Bank’s mandate must be expanded to
                    promote employ- ment, sustainable growth, and crisis prevention and mitigation.</li>
                <li>Ensure multinationals pay their fair share by collecting a minimum Euro- pean corporate tax of 15%
                    and
                    harmonising corporate taxation across Member States. Tax avoidance by multinationals has undermined
                    the
                    financing of public services for decades.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>European Parliament</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Empower Members of the European Parliament to fully represent citi- zens’ interests by being able to
                    propose bills. As the only directly-elected EU institution, the European Parliament must be given
                    the
                    right to initiate legisla- tion – just like national parliaments.</li>
                <li>Ensure that the work of the Parliament is fully transparent and prevent last-minute rewrites and
                    back-room deals. Record and make public all votes of Members of the European Parliament, and ensure
                    a
                    fixed time span for public review of bills before they are voted on.</li>
                <li>Ensure fair representation of all EU citizens and strengthen the link between citizens and their
                    representatives. This can be ensured by imple- menting the same voting rules for the European
                    Parliament
                    elections across the EU and by having citizens locally elect their Members of the European
                    Parliament,
                    whilst ensuring proportionality.</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Fix the EU - by empowering its citizens</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Europeans often feel unable to have their voice heard and to participate in decision-making processes.
                They
                often feel left out of politics. By empowering citizens, democracy will be strengthened. Firstly,
                barriers
                to inclusion need to be removed. Secondly, Europeans need to be given the
                opportunity to participate in decision-making processes beyond elections. Thirdly, conditions for
                deliberation and reasonable debate need to be put in place, to enable Europeans and policymakers to take
                informed decisions.</p>
            <h2>Inclusion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove barriers to voting for the European Parliament, by testing electronic voting to offer voters
                    better accessibility to elections, including expatriates and those with reduced mobility.</li>
                <li>Grant better access to public services and make it easy to interact with EU administrations, by
                    introducing an e-ID and by digitalizing the EU administration.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Participation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Enable Europeans to participate in policy-making, by creating digital platforms and citizen
                    assemblies.
                    This will give people the possibility to give feedback on legislative proposals, take part in
                    political
                    decisions and shape their
                    societies.</li>
                <li>Give Europeans a say in how the budget of the EU is allocated, by implementing participatory
                    budgeting.
                    EU citizens will be able to decide how a specific portion of EU funds is spent.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Deliberation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Strengthen tomorrow’s democracy with today’s education, by pushing
                    States to include media literacy, citizenship education and knowledge of institutions in their
                    curricula.
                    This will strengthen EU citizens’ active engagement in
                    public life.</li>
                <li>Create real, trustworthy European news, by introducing a common European Public Broadcasting
                    Platform.
                    This will supply EU citizens with an effective means of receiving information.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

                <h2>Fix the EU - by increasing security and accountability</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Security, transparency and anti-corruption measures are essential for generating trust in governments.
                The
                EU can and must do more on each of these fields. While Member States invest a lot in
                security, many resources are wasted due to duplication of investments and inefficiencies. The EU is
                in a better position to deal with cross-border threats. The fight against corruption and efforts
                towards better transparency need to be significantly improved.</p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Boost European defense capabilities, by establishing a European army of
                    committed Member States, while working towards the creation of EU-wide
                    permanent forces with a unified EU military command under civilian control.</li>
                <li>Strengthen European internal security, by turning the EU’s current law
                    enforcement agency (Europol) into a true federal-level police force and granting it authority to
                    fight
                    crossborder crime, terrorism and cybersecurity threats.</li>
                <li>Ensure the safety of the EU’s digital infrastructure, by making all EU software open source. This
                    will
                    reduce the dependency on monopolistic companies and will make our institutions cheaper, more
                    transparent,
                    and more resilient to data breaches.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Transparency</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase the transparency of the EU, by requiring elected officials to
                    disclose their office expenses and spending. </li>
                <li>Protect the press and whistleblowers, by introducing strict guidelines
                    limiting government punishment for the publication of confidential information in the public
                    interest.
                </li>
                <li>Make all lobbying in the European Institutions transparent and monitored. The registration of all
                    lobbying activities in the public transparency
                    register will be made mandatory, and a strict code of conduct will be introduced.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Make EU project funding dependent on national efforts to fight corruption. Member States combating
                    corruption will see their efforts rewarded, and
                    others failing to do so will be sanctioned. </li>
                <li>Stop corruption by granting new investigative powers to the European
                    Anti-Fraud and Public Prosecutor’s Offices, and increase the competences of
                    the European Ombudsman to include examining suspicious handling of public
                    funds.</li>
