            <h3>Why do we collect data?</h3>
            <p>
                Volt Europa will collect and process the data you provide us for the following purposes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep you updated about our activities, and engage with you at the local and national level
                    (where you reside, according to the information you provide us). In order to personalise
                    your communication with you, we may also use your data about previous interactions with us
                    (such as signing a petition or donating to us).</li>
                <li>Conduct quantitative and qualitative analysis, possibly in conjunction with other data you
                    might have provided us (e.g. if you signed our petitions). In this case, we will make sure
                    that your identity is kept confidential, and your data is used solely for research for the
                    purpose of Volt’s activities.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Members:</strong> Check if you meet the requirements to become a member, as defined
                    by our Statute and register you as a member of our organisation. Please notice that we are
                    obliged by law to keep a members’ list and deposit it in a freely available registry of the
                    local civil court of Luxembourg.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>Furthermore, if you live in a country where our movement has a legally established national
                organisation,
                we will conduct these activities jointly with them. You can find a list of our legally
                established national organisations here (link).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you become a <strong>European Team Member</strong>, you will be provided with an account or
                any other online tools that we use to collaborate and communicate internally. In such cases,
                Volt Europa may track your activities within our organisation, e.g. by checking when you last
                logged in. Depending on that, you might stop being contacted;
                Data generated by your usage of these services may be used for data analysis and in an
                aggregated manner. Besides that, conditions set for data analysis in general apply.

                These members of our staff will get access to your data only as far as it is needed to carry out
                their tasks (e.g, communication staff will handle your contact information as far as needed to

                organisation, unless you have consented to it.
